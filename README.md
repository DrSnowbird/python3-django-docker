# Guide - How to Generate and Start Django Project
## 1.) Generate Django Project
```
sudo docker-compose run web django-admin.py startproject composeexample .
```

After the docker-compose command completes, list the contents of your project.
```
$ ls -l ./code
total 28
drwxrwxr-x 3 user1 user1  4096 Jul  5 16:12 ./
drwxrwxr-x 4 user1 user1  4096 Jul  5 16:16 ../
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root  4096 Jul  5 16:12 composeexample/
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user1 user1   812 Jul  5 15:56 manage.py*
```
If you are running Docker on Linux, the files django-admin created are owned by __root__. This happens because the container runs as the root user. Change the ownership of the new files.
```
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
```
If you are running Docker on Mac or Windows, you should already have ownership of all files, including those generated by django-admin. List the files just to verify this.
```
$ ls -l ./code
total 28
drwxrwxr-x 3 user1 user1  4096 Jul  5 16:12 ./
drwxrwxr-x 4 user1 user1  4096 Jul  5 16:16 ../
drwxr-xr-x 3 user1 user1  4096 Jul  5 16:12 composeexample/
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user1 user1   812 Jul  5 15:56 manage.py*
```
## 2.) Start up the Django Service
Run the docker-compose up command from the top level directory for your project.
```
$ docker-compose up
djangosample_db_1 is up-to-date
Creating djangosample_web_1 ...
Creating djangosample_web_1 ... done
Attaching to djangosample_db_1, djangosample_web_1
db_1   | The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
db_1   | This user must also own the server process.
db_1   |
db_1   | The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.utf8".
db_1   | The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
db_1   | The default text search configuration will be set to "english".
. . .
web_1  | May 30, 2017 - 21:44:49
web_1  | Django version 1.11.1, using settings 'composeexample.settings'
web_1  | Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
web_1  | Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```
At this point, your Django app should be running at port 8000 on your Docker host. On Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows, go to http://localhost:8000 on a web browser to see the Django welcome page. If you are using Docker Machine, then docker-machine ip MACHINE_VM returns the Docker host IP address, to which you can append the port (<Docker-Host-IP>:8000).
